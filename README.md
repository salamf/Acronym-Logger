### What is it?
AcronLog is a convenient web application that enables users to create, view, and manage acronym definitions. It is an easy-to-use web application that streamlines the process of managing acronyms.

### How it works
- Users can create acronyms by specifying a maximum length of 10 characters for the acronym and 60 characters for its definition. 
- The application ensures that empty acronyms cannot be created.
- All created acronyms are stored in a database for easy retrieval. 
- Stored acronyms are displayed in alphabetical order. 
- Users can search for an acronym and view its definition. If the search yields no result, the application displays "Not found". 
- Users can delete an acronym, and the application removes it from the database.
